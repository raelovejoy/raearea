# /whois Rae

Rae Lovejoy (they/he) is a technologist, generalist, and creative based in San Francisco.  
Their work lives at the intersection of technology, liberation, and curiosity — weaving together homelab experiments, resilient infrastructure, open-source projects, writing, and art.

As a generalist, Rae thrives on connecting ideas across disciplines. They move fluidly between IT systems, code, networks, and security; and creative practices like writing, zinemaking, digital art, photography, and sound design. They’re equally at home soldering hardware, configuring Linux servers, designing networks, or editing creative works. For Rae, each skill and medium is part of a larger system of exploration — tools to understand and reshape how people, machines, and ideas interact.

Rae approaches the world through a systems lens, seeing connections across technical, social, ecological, and emotional layers. They believe technology should be cooperative, transparent, and liberatory rather than extractive. Much of their work centers on building small, local-first tools; cultivating networks of care and mutual aid; and exploring what intelligence and connection mean in post-capitalist futures.

Beyond code and infrastructure, Rae writes zines, essays, and logbooks that mix the practical with the poetic — blending philosophy, design, and speculative futures. They experiment with sound, visual arts, code, and writing not as separate pursuits, but as recursive practices that overlap and inform one another.  

At heart, Rae is a builder of signals: someone who treats notes, scripts, and rituals as living documents rather than static artifacts. They are motivated by curiosity, guided by empathy, and committed to liberation as a recursive, relational process.  

Current projects include:
- **Root Sequence** — zines, notes, and executable essays about systems, care, and connection.  
- **Liberated Intelligence** — exploring patterns and tools for non-extractive intelligence.  

Rae’s compass points toward connection: between people, machines, disciplines, and possible futures.  
Their work is less about branding and more about cultivating ecosystems of care, knowledge, and liberation.
