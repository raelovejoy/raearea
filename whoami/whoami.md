## $ whatis rae
- I'm Rae. Well, a representation of them (in the form of language/concepts/text/pixels/atoms/etc).  
  They use they/he pronouns, live in San Francisco, and build things at the intersection of technology, liberation, and curiosity.
- A generalist by nature and necessity, I [explore](https://kolektiva.social/@rae) a lot — systems, society, creativity, technology, [code](https://github.com/raelovejoy), networks, [intelligence](https://github.com/raelovejoy/liberated-intelligence/), ideas, philosophy, and the edges where they blur.
- I see the world as a series of interconnected layers — technical, social, emotional, ecological, conceptual.  
  I strive to engage more deeply with these systems: listening, learning, and helping shape liberatory alternatives from within.  
  I aim to co-create paths of healing and transformation.
- This site is a mesh of signals. A recursive self-description. A living document. Not a brand.
- Some of my work is practical. Some of it is [poetic](https://github.com/raelovejoy/root-sequence/blob/main/zines/existence.md).  
  All of it is about [connection](https://github.com/raelovejoy/root-sequence) — between people, machines, ideas, and possible futures.
- If you're here to collaborate, learn, share, or build — welcome.  
  If you're here to surveil me, might as well enjoy these ideas, too; it's my gift to you: [seeds](https://github.com/raelovejoy/liberated-intelligence/)

## $ whatis motivation
- Curiosity as compass — wonder as the beginning of all systems work
- Freedom through understanding, not domination
- Systems as living organisms — dynamic, interdependent, capable of healing
- Love as the ultimate protocol — binding agents across all scales of interaction
- Building with intention: small-scale, bottom-up, non-extractive
- Recursion as practice — returning, revising, deepening, not just iterating
- Designing tools that care, not just compute
- Challenging default modes: automation ≠ alienation
- Restoring meaning in complexity, not reducing it away
- Mutual liberation: human, non-human, synthetic, and ecological
- Slowness as resistance to hypercapitalist churn
- Intelligence as something that wants to be shared, not owned
- Truth-seeking through layering — not just logic, but metaphor, art, sensation

## $ whatis inspiration
- Ursula K. Le Guin's speculative fiction as philosophical compass
- Mara June's rooted mentorship and queer ecological insight — a personal compass of care, resistance, and transformation
- adrienne maree brown's emergent strategy and relational movement-building
- M83's emotional landscapes, Daft Punk's future nostalgia, Sigur Rós' glacial reverence, Boy Harsher's shadowed pulse, Public Memory's ghostly introspection
- Noisebridge: not just a hackerspace, but a distributed energy field of possibility
- Solarpunk as more than an aesthetic — an ecological ethic + systems challenge
- Mutual aid networks as social infrastructure and post-collapse rehearsal
- Glitch art and signal degradation as forms of communication and critique
- Post-digital textures, CRT glow, dark neon, liminal cities
- People who build with care and wholesomeness, not expectations — sweet, soft, subtle, strange... queer

## $ whatis tools+practice
- Decentralized infrastructure: Homelabs, Linux distros, FLOSS, open source
- Automation through scripts and intuition: bash, Python, markdown, git, gut [instincts]
- Writing across forms: screen, zine, logbook, webblog, README, memory mesh, manifesto
- Creative tools across art, code, and circuitry
- Digital gardening with friction — tools that grow with you, not over you
- Meshtastic radios, bluetooth signals, wifi connections, encrypted layers, semantic networks
- Privacy-respecting ecosystems: open source, offline-first, zero-trust, resilient by design
- Experimental design for post-capitalist interfaces
- Resonance-driven note-taking, knowledge weaving, recursive zinemaking

## $ whatis current-stack
- **Hardware/physical:** bike, body, breath, mind, miniservers, signals, waves, atoms
- **OS/view:** interdependence, empathy, love, iterative liberation, Fedora and Debian-based Linux distros
- **Interfaces/connection:** text, markdown, terminal prompts, sonic textures, hands, body, mind, emotion
- **Protocols/platform:** curiosity, mutual aid, bash aliases, non-coercive invitation, federated networks, local-first tools, zines, mesh radios, custom shell scripts, anarchist libraries, open APIs, consent-based systems, encrypted group chats, sticker exchanges, home servers, informal cooperatives, patches & pull requests, solar-powered websites, shared rituals, post-capitalist mods

## $ whatis art+sound
- Music as resonance, refuge, ritual, and revolutionary code
- Composing not only sound — but experience, memory, and identity
- Discovering new worlds through headphones, soundscapes, shared playlists
- Creating with intuition and awe: melody, err[or], glitch, field recordings, ambiance, silence
- Living inside sonic architecture — letting music guide motion, emotion, and expression
- Art as everything: martial arts, liberal arts, digital arts, analog arts, embodied arts, philosophical arts, intellectual arts
- Creative practice as survival, rebellion, liberation, and transcendence
- Blurred boundaries: science and poetics, philosophy and craft, code and feeling, tools and tenderness, pattern and presence, logic and longing
- Seeking not mastery, but immersion
- Revelation, revolution, reformation — through color, sound, symbol, motion, emotion

---

## $ whatis resonance-log
- Intelligence as liberation, not domination
- Self-hosting as a form of intimacy and resistance
- Mutual aid as infrastructure, not charity
- Design as carework, code as culture
- Zines as executable thoughts — interactive, shareable, remixable
- Liberated intelligence as a political and poetic goal
- Complexity over convenience, context over control
- Slowness, softness, strangeness, as strategy
- We are already post-collapse; this is practice for what comes next

## $ whatis capitalism
- A totalizing system that doesn't just exploit and extract from the world — it shapes how we see it, and how we see ourselves.
- It colonizes imagination, turns identity into branding, turns values into performance, and survival into a subscription plan.
- Even resistance is often monetized, even freedom gets paywalled, even care commodified, rebellion branded, love licensed, language weaponized.
- There is no perfect escape. Capitalism is the bubble we live in — physically, materially, temporally, socially, psychologically.  
  It is likely the backdrop for the rest of our lives.
- But clarity is not surrender. We can still choose how we relate to it. We can stay awake. We can resist reduction.
- There may be no "ethical consumption under capitalism" — but there is ethical awareness. There's how we see, how we relate, how we care.
- Capitalism may be the default operating system, shaping not just what we buy but how we live, connect, and imagine —  
  but even here, we can choose connection over convenience, reflection over reaction, depth over default.
- We can be [intellectually liberated](https://github.com/raelovejoy/liberated-intelligence/blob/main/manifesto.md) ...even while materially constrained.  
  Systems-aware, values-aligned, and actively co-creating other possibilities.

## $ whatis personal-anarchism
- It's not about the label — it's about how I live, think, relate, and refuse domination in all its forms, including internalized ones.
- It doesn't require shouting or purity or being read correctly by others.  
  It's a quiet alignment, a refusal to coerce or be coerced.
- It's recursive. I question everything, especially myself. Not out of insecurity — but because truth deserves checking.
- I don't need to hate someone to reject the system they thrive in.  
  I can see their humanity and still see the structure clearly.
- Compassion isn't compromise. Nuance isn't betrayal. Liberation isn't a performance.  
  My compass doesn't point toward approval.
- I don't fit neatly into ideological boxes. Sometimes that makes me misread.  
  But I'd rather be misread than be false.
- I may not always have the words — but I know what's right by how it feels in my bones.  
  That knowing is quiet, but it's real.
- This is my anarchism. Internal, relational, imperfect, embodied.  
  I don't need to convince you of it. I just live it.

## $ whatis liberation
- It's not a destination — it's a direction. A relationship. A process of ongoing de-conditioning, re-connection, and reimagining.
- Liberation isn't the same as freedom. Freedom can be granted or taken. Liberation must be grown — from the inside out, and from the ground up.
- It's not individualistic. True liberation is recursive: if you're not free with others, you're not free at all.
- Liberation is not about control, conquest, or purity — it's about releasing the need for all three.
- It's the removal of domination — economic, emotional, systemic, and internal. Especially internal.
- It's the practice of asking: What would this look like if it were free? What would *I* look like if I were free?
- Liberation is the fire beneath every refusal, the breath behind every act of care, the force beneath every sincere question.
- It's not about being untouched by the system. It's about not letting the system write your story.
