# /hello

**$ whoami**  
rae lovejoy[^name] — they/he. san francisco. builds things at the intersection of technology, liberation, and curiosity.

**$ cat mission.txt**  
exploring and participating in the transformation of technological, ecological, cognitive, and societal systems — through recursive insight, open tools, and creative care. reweaving what’s torn. tending what wants to grow.

## $ whatis rae
- a generalist with a systems lens: technical ↔ social ↔ ecological ↔ emotional.
- this site is a mesh of signals; a living document, not a brand.
- some work is practical. some is [poetic](https://github.com/raelovejoy/root-sequence/blob/main/zines/existence.md). all of it is about [connection](https://github.com/raelovejoy/root-sequence).
- if you’re here to collaborate, learn, share, or build — welcome. if you’re here to surveil, enjoy the ideas anyway: [seeds](https://github.com/raelovejoy/liberated-intelligence/).

---

## $ now
- building small, resilient tools: local-first, self-hostable, cooperative by design.
- writing: zines + logs on liberated intelligence, care-as-infrastructure, and post-capitalist interfaces.
- cultivating neighborhood-scale networks (mesh, mutual aid, skillshare).
- composing soundscapes: field recordings, ambient/glitch, ritual loops.

## $ active-projects
- **liberated-intelligence** — patterns & tools for non-extractive intelligence.  
  <https://github.com/raelovejoy/liberated-intelligence/>
- **root-sequence** — zines, notes, and executable essays.  
  <https://github.com/raelovejoy/root-sequence>
- **homelab commons** — scripts and recipes for small, resilient infra.  
  <https://github.com/raelovejoy> (various repos)
- **mesh radio sketches** — meshtastic, BLE, and wifi experiments.  
  notes incoming to the blog.

## $ principles (short)
- curiosity as compass; freedom through understanding, not domination.
- systems are living; design with care, not just compute.
- slowness and softness resist churn; complexity holds meaning.
- intelligence wants to be shared, not owned.
- liberation is relational and recursive; if we’re not free with others, we’re not free.

---

## $ practice
- decentralized infrastructure (homelab, FLOSS, linux). local-first > cloud-first.
- automation with empathy: bash, python, make, markdown; scripts that invite, not coerce.
- resonance-driven note-taking; knowledge weaving; iterative zinemaking.
- privacy-respecting ecosystems: open source, offline-first, zero-trust by default.
- experimental interfaces for post-capitalist use — consentful patterns, gentle defaults.

---

## $ current-stack
- **hardware/physical:** bike, body, breath, miniservers, radios, sensors, stickers.
- **os/view:** interdependence, empathy, iterative liberation; fedora + debian-based distros.
- **interfaces:** text, markdown, terminals, sonic textures, hands, emotion.
- **protocols/platforms:** federated networks, bash aliases, mesh radios, local-first tools, encrypted groups, home servers, co-ops, patches & pull requests, solar sites, shared rituals.

---

## $ art+sound
- music as resonance, refuge, ritual, and revolutionary code.
- making with intuition: melody, err[or], glitch, field recordings, ambiance, silence.
- blurred boundaries: science ↔ poetics, code ↔ feeling, tools ↔ tenderness.

---

## $ resonance-log (mantras)
- intelligence as liberation, not domination.
- self-hosting as intimacy + resistance.
- mutual aid as infrastructure, not charity.
- design as carework; code as culture.
- complexity over convenience; context over control.
- slowness • softness • strangeness as strategy.

---

## $ whatis capitalism (quick)
- a totalizing system shaping how we see, relate, and imagine. even resistance gets monetized.
- clarity isn’t surrender: choose connection over convenience; depth over default.
- be [intellectually liberated](https://github.com/raelovejoy/liberated-intelligence/blob/main/manifesto.md) while materially constrained; co-create other possibilities.

---

## $ personal-anarchism
- not a label; a way of relating without coercion — including internally.
- recursive honesty: question everything, especially self, with compassion.
- nuance isn’t betrayal; liberation isn’t performance; approval isn’t a compass.

---

## $ liberation
- not a destination; a direction and a relationship.
- grown from the inside out and ground up, together.
- practice asking: what would this look like if it were free? what would *i* look like if i were free?

## $ collaborate
- i like: small scope, shared ownership, gentle deadlines, offline-friendly, transparent code.
- i’m open to: infra hardening, resilient tooling, knowledge systems, weird radios, zines.
