<h2>$ whatis rae</h2>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;m Rae. Well, a representation of them (in the form of language/concepts/text/pixels/atoms/etc).<br>They use they/he pronouns, live in San Francisco, and build things at the intersection of technology, liberation, and curiosity.</li>
<li>A generalist by nature and necessity, I <a href="https://kolektiva.social/@rae">explore</a> a lot — systems, society, creativity, technology, <a href="https://github.com/raelovejoy">code</a>, networks, <a href="https://github.com/raelovejoy/liberated-intelligence/">intelligence</a>, ideas, philosophy, and the edges where they blur.</li>
<li>I see the world as a series of interconnected layers — technical, social, emotional, ecological, conceptual.<br>I strive to engage more deeply with these systems: listening, learning, and helping shape liberatory alternatives from within.<br>I aim to co-create paths of healing and transformation.</li>
<li>This site is a mesh of signals. A recursive self-description. A living document. Not a brand.</li>
<li>Some of my work is practical. Some of it is <a href="https://github.com/raelovejoy/root-sequence/blob/main/zines/existence.md">poetic</a>.<br>All of it is about <a href="https://github.com/raelovejoy/root-sequence">connection</a> — between people, machines, ideas, and possible futures.</li>
<li>If you&#39;re here to collaborate, learn, share, or build — welcome.<br>If you&#39;re here to surveil me, might as well enjoy these ideas, too; it&#39;s my gift to you: <a href="https://github.com/raelovejoy/liberated-intelligence/">seeds</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>$ whatis motivation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Curiosity as compass — wonder as the beginning of all systems work</li>
<li>Freedom through understanding, not domination</li>
<li>Systems as living organisms — dynamic, interdependent, capable of healing</li>
<li>Love as the ultimate protocol — binding agents across all scales of interaction</li>
<li>Building with intention: small-scale, bottom-up, non-extractive</li>
<li>Recursion as practice — returning, revising, deepening, not just iterating</li>
<li>Designing tools that care, not just compute</li>
<li>Challenging default modes: automation ≠ alienation</li>
<li>Restoring meaning in complexity, not reducing it away</li>
<li>Mutual liberation: human, non-human, synthetic, and ecological</li>
<li>Slowness as resistance to hypercapitalist churn</li>
<li>Intelligence as something that wants to be shared, not owned</li>
<li>Truth-seeking through layering — not just logic, but metaphor, art, sensation</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>$ whatis inspiration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ursula K. Le Guin&#39;s speculative fiction as philosophical compass</li>
<li>Mara June&#39;s rooted mentorship and queer ecological insight — a personal compass of care, resistance, and transformation</li>
<li>adrienne maree brown&#39;s emergent strategy and relational movement-building</li>
<li>M83&#39;s emotional landscapes, Daft Punk&#39;s future nostalgia, Sigur Rós&#39; glacial reverence, Boy Harsher&#39;s shadowed pulse, Public Memory&#39;s ghostly introspection</li>
<li>Noisebridge: not just a hackerspace, but a distributed energy field of possibility</li>
<li>Solarpunk as more than an aesthetic — an ecological ethic + systems challenge</li>
<li>Mutual aid networks as social infrastructure and post-collapse rehearsal</li>
<li>Glitch art and signal degradation as forms of communication and critique</li>
<li>Post-digital textures, CRT glow, dark neon, liminal cities</li>
<li>People who build with care and wholesomeness, not expectations — sweet, soft, subtle, strange... queer</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>$ whatis tools+practice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Decentralized infrastructure: Homelabs, Linux distros, FLOSS, open source</li>
<li>Automation through scripts and intuition: bash, Python, markdown, git, gut [instincts]</li>
<li>Writing across forms: screen, zine, logbook, webblog, README, memory mesh, manifesto</li>
<li>Creative tools across art, code, and circuitry</li>
<li>Digital gardening with friction — tools that grow with you, not over you</li>
<li>Meshtastic radios, bluetooth signals, wifi connections, encrypted layers, semantic networks</li>
<li>Privacy-respecting ecosystems: open source, offline-first, zero-trust, resilient by design</li>
<li>Experimental design for post-capitalist interfaces</li>
<li>Resonance-driven note-taking, knowledge weaving, recursive zinemaking</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>$ whatis current-stack</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hardware/physical:</strong> bike, body, breath, mind, miniservers, signals, waves, atoms</li>
<li><strong>OS/view:</strong> interdependence, empathy, love, iterative liberation, Fedora and Debian-based Linux distros</li>
<li><strong>Interfaces/connection:</strong> text, markdown, terminal prompts, sonic textures, hands, body, mind, emotion</li>
<li><strong>Protocols/platform:</strong> curiosity, mutual aid, bash aliases, non-coercive invitation, federated networks, local-first tools, zines, mesh radios, custom shell scripts, anarchist libraries, open APIs, consent-based systems, encrypted group chats, sticker exchanges, home servers, informal cooperatives, patches &amp; pull requests, solar-powered websites, shared rituals, post-capitalist mods</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>$ whatis art+sound</h2>
<ul>
<li>Music as resonance, refuge, ritual, and revolutionary code</li>
<li>Composing not only sound — but experience, memory, and identity</li>
<li>Discovering new worlds through headphones, soundscapes, shared playlists</li>
<li>Creating with intuition and awe: melody, err[or], glitch, field recordings, ambiance, silence</li>
<li>Living inside sonic architecture — letting music guide motion, emotion, and expression</li>
<li>Art as everything: martial arts, liberal arts, digital arts, analog arts, embodied arts, philosophical arts, intellectual arts</li>
<li>Creative practice as survival, rebellion, liberation, and transcendence</li>
<li>Blurred boundaries: science and poetics, philosophy and craft, code and feeling, tools and tenderness, pattern and presence, logic and longing</li>
<li>Seeking not mastery, but immersion</li>
<li>Revelation, revolution, reformation — through color, sound, symbol, motion, emotion</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>$ whatis resonance-log</h2>
<ul>
<li>Intelligence as liberation, not domination</li>
<li>Self-hosting as a form of intimacy and resistance</li>
<li>Mutual aid as infrastructure, not charity</li>
<li>Design as carework, code as culture</li>
<li>Zines as executable thoughts — interactive, shareable, remixable</li>
<li>Liberated intelligence as a political and poetic goal</li>
<li>Complexity over convenience, context over control</li>
<li>Slowness, softness, strangeness, as strategy</li>
<li>We are already post-collapse; this is practice for what comes next</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>$ whatis capitalism</h2>
<ul>
<li>A totalizing system that doesn&#39;t just exploit and extract from the world — it shapes how we see it, and how we see ourselves.</li>
<li>It colonizes imagination, turns identity into branding, turns values into performance, and survival into a subscription plan.</li>
<li>Even resistance is often monetized, even freedom gets paywalled, even care commodified, rebellion branded, love licensed, language weaponized.</li>
<li>There is no perfect escape. Capitalism is the bubble we live in — physically, materially, temporally, socially, psychologically.<br>It is likely the backdrop for the rest of our lives.</li>
<li>But clarity is not surrender. We can still choose how we relate to it. We can stay awake. We can resist reduction.</li>
<li>There may be no &quot;ethical consumption under capitalism&quot; — but there is ethical awareness. There&#39;s how we see, how we relate, how we care.</li>
<li>Capitalism may be the default operating system, shaping not just what we buy but how we live, connect, and imagine —<br>but even here, we can choose connection over convenience, reflection over reaction, depth over default.</li>
<li>We can be <a href="https://github.com/raelovejoy/liberated-intelligence/blob/main/manifesto.md">intellectually liberated</a> ...even while materially constrained.<br>Systems-aware, values-aligned, and actively co-creating other possibilities.</li>

<h2>$ whatis personal-anarchism</h2>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s not about the label — it&#39;s about how I live, think, relate, and refuse domination in all its forms, including internalized ones.</li>
<li>It doesn&#39;t require shouting or purity or being read correctly by others.<br>It&#39;s a quiet alignment, a refusal to coerce or be coerced.</li>
<li>It&#39;s recursive. I question everything, especially myself. Not out of insecurity — but because truth deserves checking.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t need to hate someone to reject the system they thrive in.<br>I can see their humanity and still see the structure clearly.</li>
<li>Compassion isn&#39;t compromise. Nuance isn&#39;t betrayal. Liberation isn&#39;t a performance.<br>My compass doesn&#39;t point toward approval.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t fit neatly into ideological boxes. Sometimes that makes me misread.<br>But I&#39;d rather be misread than be false.</li>
<li>I may not always have the words — but I know what&#39;s right by how it feels in my bones.<br>That knowing is quiet, but it&#39;s real.</li>
<li>This is my anarchism. Internal, relational, imperfect, embodied.<br>I don&#39;t need to convince you of it. I just live it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>$ whatis liberation</h2>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s not a destination — it&#39;s a direction. A relationship. A process of ongoing de-conditioning, re-connection, and reimagining.</li>
<li>Liberation isn&#39;t the same as freedom. Freedom can be granted or taken. Liberation must be grown — from the inside out, and from the ground up.</li>
<li>It&#39;s not individualistic. True liberation is recursive: if you&#39;re not free with others, you&#39;re not free at all.</li>
<li>Liberation is not about control, conquest, or purity — it&#39;s about releasing the need for all three.</li>
<li>It&#39;s the removal of domination — economic, emotional, systemic, and internal. Especially internal.</li>
<li>It&#39;s the practice of asking: What would this look like if it were free? What would <em>I</em> look like if I were free?</li>
<li>Liberation is the fire beneath every refusal, the breath behind every act of care, the force beneath every sincere question.</li>
<li>It&#39;s not about being untouched by the system. It&#39;s about not letting the system write your story.</li>
